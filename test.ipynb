       "Okay, here is a research article discussing Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) associated with CAR T-cell therapy, based on the provided search results from PubMed:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Cytokine Release Syndrome in CAR T-cell Therapy: An Overview**\n",
       "\n",
       "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary treatment for hematological malignancies, offering new hope for patients with relapsed or refractory disease [1](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17020282). However, this powerful therapy is associated with unique and potentially life-threatening toxicities, most notably Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) [1](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17020282). CRS is a systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation and proliferation of CAR T-cells, which release large amounts of cytokines [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12672-025-01776-0).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pathophysiology of CRS**\n",
       "\n",
       "The pathophysiology of CRS is complex, involving a cascade of immune cell activation and cytokine release. When CAR T-cells encounter their target antigen on tumor cells, they become activated, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12672-025-01776-0). This cytokine storm can result in a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild flu-like symptoms to severe multi-organ dysfunction. Macrophages and other cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) also play a role in amplifying the hyperinflammatory cascade [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12672-025-01776-0).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Clinical Manifestations of CRS**\n",
       "\n",
       "The clinical presentation of CRS is highly variable. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. In more severe cases, patients may experience hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, and organ dysfunction [1](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17020282).  A notable manifestation of severe CRS is craniocervical edema, which can lead to airway obstruction and asphyxia [13](https://doi.org/10.1093/omcr/omae164). The severity of CRS is graded based on clinical criteria, with higher grades indicating more severe symptoms and requiring more intensive management.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Risk Factors for CRS**\n",
       "\n",
       "Several factors can influence the risk and severity of CRS. These include the tumor burden, the intensity of the CAR T-cell dose, and the patient's underlying health status [5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56270-6).  Notably, the timing of CAR-T therapy in the course of the disease can affect the incidence of CRS; a study showed that patients receiving CAR-T therapy earlier in their treatment course had a lower rate of grade ≥2 CRS compared to those receiving it later [4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41409-025-02519-z).  Additionally, specific CAR-T cell products and their targets can also affect the likelihood of CRS [10](https://doi.org/10.3390/v17010133). For instance, patients receiving CAR-T therapy for AML have been shown to have a high incidence of CRS, with some experiencing severe grades [3](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1491341).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Management of CRS**\n",
       "\n",
       "The cornerstone of CRS management involves supportive care and targeted therapies to reduce the inflammatory response. Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor, is commonly used to mitigate the effects of IL-6, a key cytokine in CRS [3](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1491341). Corticosteroids are also frequently used, particularly in severe cases [13](https://doi.org/10.1093/omcr/omae164). In some instances, other therapies, such as anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, may be used as a corticosteroid-sparing option [14](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-024-04905-5).  However, it is important to note that the use of tocilizumab has been implicated as a possible factor in gastrointestinal complications like small intestine perforations [3](https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.3815-24).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Emerging Strategies**\n",
       "\n",
       "Ongoing research is focused on improving the management of CRS and other CAR T-cell therapy-related toxicities. This includes the development of novel biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification, as well as the exploration of strategies to modulate the MPS to optimize CAR-T cell efficacy while minimizing toxicity [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12672-025-01776-0). Additionally, there is interest in modifying CAR T-cell design to reduce their pro-inflammatory potential and in developing prophylactic strategies to prevent CRS [3](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1491341).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion**\n",
       "\n",
       "CRS remains a significant challenge in CAR T-cell therapy. Understanding its complex pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and risk factors is crucial for effective management. While current treatments such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids have improved patient outcomes, further research is needed to develop safer and more effective strategies to prevent and manage CRS, ultimately improving the overall safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Follow-up Questions:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  How do different CAR T-cell constructs (e.g., different target antigens, co-stimulatory domains) influence the incidence and severity of CRS?\n",
       "2.  What are the long-term consequences of CRS, and how do they impact the overall outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy?\n",
       "3.  Can specific biomarkers be used to predict the onset and severity of CRS, enabling proactive intervention?\n",
       "4.  How does the tumor microenvironment contribute to the development of CRS, and can targeting this environment help to mitigate CRS?\n",
       "5.  What is the role of the mononuclear phagocytic system in the development and amplification of CRS, and how can we target this system to reduce toxicity?"

      "## Imaging Findings of Complications of New Anticancer Drugs.\n",
      "**PMID**: 39898396 | **DOI**: 10.3348/kjr.2024.0195 | **Published**: --\n",
      "\n",
      "**Abstract**:\n",
      "The anticancer drugs have evolved significantly, spanning molecular targeted therapeutics (MTTs), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Complications associated with these drugs vary widely based on their mechanisms of action. MTTs that target angiogenesis can often lead to complications related to ischemia or endothelial damage across various organs, whereas non-anti-angiogenic MTTs present unique complications derived from their specific pharmacological actions. ICIs are predominantly associated with immune-related adverse events, such as pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, thyroid disorders, hypophysitis, and sarcoid-like reactions. CAR-T therapy causes unique and severe complications including cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. ADCs tend to cause complications associated with cytotoxic payloads. A comprehensive understanding of these drug-specific toxicities, particularly using medical imaging, is essential for providing optimal patient care. Based on this knowledge, radiologists can play a pivotal role in multidisciplinary teams. Therefore, radiologists must stay up-to-date on the imaging characteristics of these complications and the mechanisms underlying novel anticancer drugs.\n",

      "**PMID**: 39896798 | **DOI**: 10.3389/fimmu.2024.1491341 | **Published**: 2025-01-17\n",
      "\n",
      "**Abstract**:\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Human C-type lectin-like molecule 1 (CLL-1) represents a promising therapeutic target for Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells therapy in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of donor-derived CLL-1 CAR-T cells in AML patients who experienced relapsed post-transplantation.\n",
      "METHODS: 14 AML patients who experienced relapse following allogeneic HSCT were enrolled in our clinical trial. However, 2 patients withdrew from the study due to rapid disease progression. 12 participants received donor-derived CLL-1 CAR-T cells and were categorized into 3 groups based on the dosage of infused CAR-T cells dose (Group A:0.5×10/kg, Group B:1×10/kg, Group C:1.5×10/kg). And scRNA-seq was used to reveal CLL-1 CAR-T cells dynamics in a CAR-T cells infusion products and PBMCs at the peak of expansion for patient 4.\n",
      "RESULTS: CLL-1 CAR-T cells were well tolerated by all 12 patients. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) was observed in all patients, with 5 patients experiencing grade ≥3. 3 patients developed cytokine release syndrome-associated encephalopathy (CRES), and 1 patient had a grade 4 severity level. All patients demonstrated a reduction in tumor burden, while 7 patients (58.33%) achieved MRD-CR and 2 patients (16.67%) reached MRD+CR. CAR-T cells expansion was detectable in all 12 patients, with the median time of peak expansion was 9 days (range: 7-11 days). In patient 4, compared to the pre-reinfusion state, CD4+ cells at the peak of expansion showed upregulation of cell killing-related genes and memory T cell-related genes ( < 0.01).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The CLL-1 CAR-T cells therapy derived from allogeneic donors demonstrates both safety and efficacy in the management of relapsed AML following allogeneic HSCT. And adjusting the ratio of CD4+ CAR-T cells and CD8+ CAR-T cells prior to infusion may help mitigate CAR-T cell-related side effects.\n",

We herein report an 81-year-old woman who experienced multiple perforations in the small intestine 8 days after tisagenlecleucel infusion for relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma with no gastrointestinal involvement. A pathological examination of the resected small intestine revealed multiple ulcers that formed after resection but without lymphoma involvement. Based on these findings, tocilizumab used for cytokine release syndrome was considered to be associated with these lesions. This case illustrates a previously undescribed but serious sequela of CAR T-cell therapy, calling for relevant personnel to be vigilant about gastrointestinal symptoms.\n",

      "CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has recently been approved as second-line treatment for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). This study compares patterns of disease relapse and progression across patients receiving CAR-T as second-line (early administration) versus third or subsequent lines (late administration). We analyzed 354 patients treated with Axicabtagene ciloleucel (71%) and Lisocabtagene maraleucel (29%); 80 (23%) received early administration, and 274 (77%) late administration. One-year overall survival was higher in the early group (82% [95% CI 72-93] vs. 71% [95% CI 66-77], p = 0.048). However, the survival benefit was not sustained in multivariable Cox regression modeling and propensity score matching. One-year cumulative incidences of relapse were similar (37% [95% CI 24-50] vs. 43% [95% CI 37-49], p = 0.2), as were 1-year progression-free survival probabilities (62% [95% CI 50-76] vs. 50% [95% CI 44-57], p = 0.14). The early group exhibited a favorable toxicity profile, with lower rate of grade ≥2 cytokine release syndrome (26% vs. 39%, p = 0.031) and reduced cumulative incidence of severe neutropenia (41% [95% CI 30-52] vs. 55% [95% CI 49-60], p = 0.027). Our results indicate favorable outcomes with CAR-T irrespective of treatment line. The equivalence in disease control suggests that CAR-T resistance mechanisms persist in LBCL failing first-line therapy.\n",

      "**Abstract**:\n",
      "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cell therapy holds promise for treating myeloid malignancies, but challenges remain in bone marrow (BM) infiltration and targeting BM-resident malignant cells. Current autologous CAR-T therapies also face manufacturing and patient selection issues, underscoring the need for off-the-shelf products. In this study, we characterize primary patient samples and identify a unique therapeutic opportunity for CAR-engineered invariant natural killer T (CAR-NKT) cells. Using stem cell gene engineering and a clinically guided culture method, we generate allogeneic CD33-directed CAR-NKT cells with high yield, purity, and robustness. In preclinical mouse models, CAR-NKT cells exhibit strong BM homing and effectively target BM-resident malignant blast cells, including CD33-low/negative leukemia stem and progenitor cells. Furthermore, CAR-NKT cells synergize with hypomethylating agents, enhancing tumor-killing efficacy. These cells also show minimal off-tumor toxicity, reduced graft-versus-host disease and cytokine release syndrome risks, and resistance to allorejection, highlighting their substantial therapeutic potential for treating myeloid malignancies.\n",

      "CD7-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy has shown great promise in the treatment of relapsed/refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In this study, we reported a case of a 34-year-old male patient with T-ALL who finally developed multi-line drug resistance and refractoriness after multiple lines of high-intensity chemotherapy. After physician evaluation, this patient received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Then, The patient remained in complete remission (CR) for four months before a relapse with 26.64% chimerism rate, so he was treated with allogeneic anti-CD7 CAR-T cells after chemotherapy reducing the tumor burden. The CAR-T product was a novel anti-CD7 CAR-T based on retroviral vectors (RV). After infusion, the patient achieved CR within 1 month after anti-CD7 CAR-T infusion and the remission has been ongoing for 9 months to date. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 1 was experienced while no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was found. In addition, CAR copy number peaked at 350, 758 copies/μg on day 6. This case report of clinical treatment of T-ALL with anti-CD7 CAR-T cells prepared using a retroviral vector without gene editing and combined with chemotherapy, which demonstrated that the RV-based anti-CD7 CAR-T cells had good therapeutic effect and high safety in triple-refractory T-ALL patients.\n",

      "**PMID**: 39875173 | **DOI**: 10.1136/jitc-2024-010649 | **Published**: 2025-01-28\n",
      "\n",
      "**Abstract**:\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Polyclonal autologous T cells that are epigenetically reprogrammed through mTOR inhibition and IFN-α polarization (RAPA-201) represent a novel approach to the adoptive T cell therapy of cancer. Ex vivo inhibition of mTOR results causes a shift towards T central memory (T) whereas ex vivo IFN-α promotes type I cytokines, with each of these functions known to enhance the adoptive T cell therapy of cancer. Rapamycin-resistant T cells polarized for a type II cytokine phenotype were previously evaluated in the allogeneic transplantation context.\n",
      "METHODS: The clinical trial (NCT04176380) evaluated RAPA-201 therapy in combination with fludarabine-sparing low-dose host conditioning for the treatment of patients with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).\n",
      "RESULTS: From December 2020 to December 2022, 14 patients with RRMM received a median of three RAPA-201 infusions (median dose, 80×10 cells). RAPA-201 drug products (DPs) were: polyclonal; enriched for T cells; reduced for immune checkpoint expression, including PD1, CD73, and LAIR1; and preferentially secreted Th1 cytokines. The median chemotherapy dose administered per cycle was 1,817 mg total for cyclophosphamide (range, 1,100-2,200) and 2.35 mg/M for pentostatin (range, 0-16). Nine of 14 patients (64%) achieved disease remission, with eight partial responses and one stringent complete response. Median progression-free survival was 6.0 months (range, 2.1 to>16.8 months). There were no toxicities of any grade attributable to RAPA-201, including no cytokine release syndrome and no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Only 4 of 14 patients (29%) had a serious adverse event (≥ grade 3) of any attribution.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with our hypothesis, ex vivo manufacturing using mTOR inhibition and IFN-α polarization consistently yielded a novel RAPA-201 DP that possessed a desirable phenotype relative to cytokine phenotype, memory status, and checkpoint expression. RAPA-201 recipients had preservation of T cell counts and Th1 cytokine secretion yet had increased T cell receptor clonality that associates with antitumor responses in the setting of monoclonal antibody checkpoint therapy. RAPA-201 therapy overcomes previous barriers to effective autologous polyclonal T-cell therapy, as it is feasible to manufacture, exquisitely safe to administer, and mediates remission in patients with RRMM.\n",

      "**Abstract**:\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy has been a breakthrough in treatment of primary refractory or relapsed large B-cell lymphoma (r/r LBCL) and is poised to supplant previous second line of high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT). However, in clinical practice, high risk patients with chemoimmunotherapy sensitive disease continue to receive salvage chemoimmunotherapy or cannot access CAR-T in a timely manner and thus may still proceed to HDT/ASCT. Little is known about clinical outcomes of CAR-T in patients who receive HDT/ASCT compared to those who are transplant-naïve.\n",
      "DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with r/r LBCL who previously underwent HDT/ASCT or were transplant-naïve (n = 97) and received axicabtagene ciloleucel after at least 2 prior therapy lines between 1/1/2018 to 12/31/2021. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and cumulative incidence of relapse/progression.\n",
      "RESULTS: 82 (84.5%) patients were transplant-naïve and 15 (15.5%) previously received HDT/ASCT. No differences were found in the incidence of high-grade cytokine release syndrome or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, length of hospital admission, or incidence of cytopenia at day 30. 90-day response, PFS, OS, cumulative incidence of relapse/progression, and NRM were not different. Factors that adversely affected outcomes were prior bridging therapy, elevated LDH or thrombocytopenia at time of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and worse ECOG performance status.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Prior treatment with HDT/ASCT does not compromise the safety and efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy, suggesting a continued role for HDT/ASCT in treatment of select patients with r/r DLBCL.\n",

      "In this narrative review, we explore the burden and risk factors of various herpesvirus infections in patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy or bispecific antibodies (BsAb) for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Antiviral prophylaxis for herpes simplex/varicella zoster viruses became part of the standard of care in this patient population. Breakthrough infections may rarely occur, and the optimal duration of prophylaxis as well as the timing of recombinant zoster immunization remain to be explored. Clinically significant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections can affect up to 10% of patients after CAR-T, depending on the CAR-T product target, post-CAR-T complications such as cytokine release syndrome and the need for glucocorticoid therapy. Surveillance and prophylactic strategies for CMV need to be developed, whereas the risk factors for and the burden of CMV infections after BsAb are not yet well-defined. Human herpes virus 6 reactivation and end organ disease such as encephalitis are rarely reported after CAR-T and have not yet been reported after BsAb; additional research is needed.\n",

      "Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (or CAR-T) therapy and bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, offering new options for relapsed or refractory cases. However, these therapies carry risks of early complications, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and delayed issues like graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infections, and secondary cancers. Effective management requires early diagnosis using advanced biomarkers and imaging, along with prompt interventions involving immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and cytokine inhibitors. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, integrating hematologists, oncologists, and infectious disease specialists, with emerging strategies like targeted biologics and personalized medicine showing promise in balancing efficacy with toxicity management. Ongoing research is critical to refine diagnostics and treatments, ensuring that these therapies not only extend survival but also improve patients' quality of life. This review provides critical insights for healthcare professionals to quickly recognize and treat complications of CAR-T and BsAbs therapies. By focusing on early detection through biomarkers and imaging and outlining timely therapeutic interventions, it aims to equip the multidisciplinary care team with the knowledge necessary to manage the challenges of these advanced treatments effectively, ultimately optimizing patient outcomes.\n",

      "Nova Scotia (NS) began offering CAR T-cell therapy as a third-line standard of care for eligible patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (r/r LBCL) in 2022. Recipients of CAR T-cell therapy often experience acute toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which require close monitoring and prompt management. This retrospective review aimed to describe the characteristics of adult patients with r/r LBCL deemed eligible to receive CAR T-cell therapy with axicabtagene ciloleucel in NS between January 2022 and June 2024, the toxicities experienced and toxicity management, hospital visits and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, the utilization of toxicity management guidelines, and general efficacy outcomes. Twenty-seven patients received axicabtagene ciloleucel. All patients experienced CRS (7.4% grade ≥ 3), and 55.6% developed ICANS (25.9% grade ≥ 3). The median hospital stay was 18 days, with 40.7% requiring ICU admission. There was one treatment-related mortality. Most CRS (85.2%) and ICANS (80.0%) cases were managed according to the guidelines. By day +100, the best objective response rate was 81.5% (44.4% complete responses). Patients who received CAR T-cell therapy in NS, Canada, experienced comparable toxicities and efficacy to those reported in pivotal clinical trials and other real-world experiences.\n",

      "**Abstract**:\n",
      "CAR-T therapy (chimeric antigen receptor T-cell) has revolutionized the prognosis of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that have relapsed or are refractory to conventional chemotherapies. In particular, patients who have relapsed or are refractory to two lines of therapy are patients who have a poor prognosis. The advent of CAR-T immunotherapy is an innovative approach with which we can give hope of recovery even in the case of refractory disease, even for patients who are not candidates for high-dose therapies, for example due to age. Here we present a clinical case of a 74-year-old patient at second relapse, refractory to two lines of chemotherapy and subjected to third-line CAR-T with axicabtagene ciloleucel, after a good response to bridge therapy with rituximab polatuzumab and bendamustine (RPB). Complete remission of the disease still persists eleven months after treatment. Tolerance to CAR-T was excellent, with grade 1 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), no neurological complications (ICANS-immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome) and no infectious complications. Severe hypogammaglobulinemia persists eleven months after CAR-T reinfusion, for which he still performs immunoglobulin replenishment for prophylactic purposes.\n",

      "Craniocervical edema appears soon after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy in some cases. This phenomenon is often observed right after systemic cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and it is called local CRS (L-CRS). In severe cases, L-CRS causes airway obstruction and asphyxia, but it is not yet well known among hematologists. In this report, we present mild and severe cases of L-CRS. Tocilizumab might have limited efficacy against L-CRS, and early administration of corticosteroids can be important. We hope that this case report raises awareness of L-CRS as an acute-onset adverse event after CAR-T therapy.\n",

      "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper reviewed the current literature on incidence, clinical manifestations, and risk factors of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) cardiotoxicity.\n",
      "RECENT FINDINGS: CAR-T therapy has emerged as a groundbreaking treatment for hematological malignancies since FDA approval in 2017. CAR-T therapy is however associated with a few side effects, among which cardiotoxicity is of significant concern. There were only a few studies on CAR-T cardiotoxicity published to date with limited sample sizes, and their findings were heterogeneous. It was difficult to reach generalizable conclusions. CAR-T therapy was associated with significant risks for acute and subacute cardiotoxicity, as measured by echocardiograms, EKG, and blood biomarkers. Patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade 2 or higher were more likely to exhibit cardiotoxicity. The most prevalent cardiac events included hypotension-requiring inotropic or vasopressor support, tachycardia, heart failure/decompensation, atrial fibrillation, new or worsening cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and cardiovascular death. The most prevalent echocardiographic changes were systolic dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction, and abnormal echocardiogram findings. There were differences in findings between adult and pediatric patients. The long-term effects beyond a year post treatment remain largely unknown and long-term follow-up studies are warranted.\n",

      "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, achieving remarkable clinical success with FDA-approved therapies targeting CD19 and BCMA. However, the extension of these successes to solid tumors remains limited due to several intrinsic challenges, including antigen heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in CAR T cell therapy aimed at overcoming these obstacles. We discuss the importance of antigen identification by emphasizing the identification of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens and the development of CAR T therapies targeting these antigens. Furthermore, we highlight key structural innovations, including cytokine-armored CARs, protease-regulated CARs, and CARs engineered with chemokine receptors, to enhance tumor infiltration and activity within the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Additionally, novel manufacturing approaches, such as the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, mRNA-based CAR transfection, and  CAR T cell production, are discussed as scalable solution to improve the accessibility of CAR T cell therapies. Finally, we address critical therapeutic limitations, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and suboptimal persistence of CAR T cells. An examination of emerging strategies for countering these limitations reveals that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genetic modifications and combination therapies utilizing checkpoint inhibitors can improve CAR T cell functionality and durability. By integrating insights from preclinical models, clinical trials, and innovative engineering approaches, this review addresses advances in CAR T cell therapies and their performance in solid tumors.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Mantle cell lymphoma is a diverse B-cell lymphoma with varying clinical behaviors. Treating relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma is challenging, with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors proving effective but not curative. Post-Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor failure, the prognosis remains unfavorable. Brexucabtagene autoleucel, a US Food and Drug and European Medicines Agency-approved anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, marks a significant breakthrough offering hope in this challenging scenario.\n",
      "CASE PRESENTATION: This article presents an analysis of the management of short-term chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy-associated toxicities, focusing on a specific case of a patient with refractory mantle cell lymphoma. The report underscores the complexities of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell treatment and sheds light on strategies employed to mitigate toxic effects. The case involves a white Caucasian 59-year-old male affected by relapsed mantle cell lymphoma who underwent various treatments, including autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (brexucabtagene autoleucel). The patient experienced immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity along with cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, necessitating intervention. The management involved a combination of tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and anakinra, which effectively alleviated symptoms. Additionally, the article highlights the patient's case of intestinal perforation following CAR-T therapy. Although there is a correlation between gastrointestinal perforation and interleukin 6 receptor inhibitors, the adverse event was attributed to the patient's preexisting diverticulitis and the immunosuppressive drugs administered leading to cytomegalovirus reactivation. The study emphasizes the evolving landscape of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and the significance of addressing toxicities associated with this innovative treatment approach. It underscores the value of anakinra as a potential corticosteroid-sparing therapy for immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome and raises the need for further research to optimize the management of immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity and associated complications. The potential preventive use of drugs to mitigate toxicities also warrants exploration, albeit with the current dearth of evidence.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this article offers valuable insights into the challenges of managing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell-related toxicities through a detailed case presentation and highlights the significance of adopting multidisciplinary approaches to enhance patient outcomes and safety. Further research is needed to refine strategies and advance the understanding of these complex treatment-associated toxicities.\n",

      "**Abstract**:\n",
      "Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using natural killer (NK) cells has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), addressing challenges such as chemotherapy resistance and high relapse rates. Over the years, clinical trials and studies have explored various sources of NK cells, including ex vivo expanded NK cell lines, CAR-NK cells, peripheral blood-derived NK cells, and umbilical cord blood-derived NK cells. These therapies have demonstrated varying degrees of therapeutic efficacy, ranging from transient anti-leukemia activity to sustained remission in select patient groups. Toxicity profiles have generally shown favorable safety outcomes, with minimal incidence of severe adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, persistent challenges remain, including limited NK cell persistence, relapse, and heterogeneity in patient responses. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of clinical outcomes and toxicity profiles provided from clinical trials, clinical studies and case reports conducted in the last 15 years to judge on the efficacy, safety and applicability of using NK cells for ACT of AML. Our review highlights the significant potential of NK cell-based therapies for AML, while addressing the technical and biological challenges that must be overcome to enhance their efficacy and safety.\n",

      "CAR-T cell therapies have risen to prominence over the last decade, and their indications are increasing with several products approved as early as second line in Large B Cell non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. Their major toxicities are the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the Immune-effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS). These entities involve a hyperinflammatory cascade which is amplified through the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS). Herein, we review the immune mediated adverse events related to CAR therapy, including their pathophysiologies, and current therapies. In particular, we discuss the emerging role of the MPS in both the toxicity and efficacy of CAR-T therapy, and possible avenues for the modulation of the MPS to optimize efficacy while minimizing toxicity.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Relapsed/refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R cHL) remains challenging to treat, and anti-CD30 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy may be effective. This meta-analysis investigates the efficacy and safety of anti-CD30 CAR-T cell therapy for treating R/R cHL.\n",
      "METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science databases was conducted until February 2024. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was analysed using Review Manager 5.4. Outcomes including overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs) were extracted for meta-analysis. We used the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) to evaluate the quality of the included literature.\n",
      "RESULTS: A total of 151 participants from 8 records were included. Meta-analysis showed the ORR of CD30 CAR-T cell therapy for R/R cHL was 57% (95%CI 0.36-0.76, P = 0.50), with a CR of 34% (95%CI 0.13-0.64, P = 0.29) and a PR of 32% (95%CI 0.15-0.55, P = 0.12). With the median follow-up range from 9.5 to 71.5 months, the 1-year PFS was 39% (95% CI 0.30-0.49, P = 0.04), and the 1-year OS was 89% (95% CI 0.65-0.97, P = 0.005). The most common hematologic AE was leukopenia (72%, 95% CI: 0.50-0.87), and the most common non-hematological AE was cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (43%, 95% CI: 0.14-0.76). The grade ≥ 3 AEs was 66% (95%CI 0.06-0.98, I2 = 93%, P = 0.70), 34% (95%CI 0.07-0.78, I2 = 85%, P = 0.51) in neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. All AEs were tolerable and resolved with treatment.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that anti-CD30 CAR-T cell therapy is effective and safe in treating R/R cHL and is worth considering as a viable therapeutic option.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Abstract**:\n",
      "BACKGROUND: Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is a personalized immunotherapy. The efficacy of TIL-ACT has been demonstrated prospectively in patients with advanced melanoma but is not limited to melanoma patients. Many patients are refractory to TIL-ACT, however, or their cancer becomes resistant. Combining anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) with TIL-ACT to antagonize the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment may synergize to enhance the antitumor potential.\n",
      "MATERIAL AND METHODS: We set up the  trial (NCT04165967), a single-center investigator-initiated phase I trial, to test feasibility and safety of TIL-ACT followed by PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma with disease progression after at least one line of anti-PD-1. TIL-ACT included tumor collection,  TIL expansion, lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, TIL transfer, and  TIL stimulation with interleukin 2 (125 000 IU/kg, 10 days). TIL-ACT was followed by nivolumab treatment for a maximum of 2 years. Nine patients were planned for inclusion.\n",
      "RESULTS: Between 2020 and 2022, we enrolled 11 patients and 9 underwent a TIL transfer (median transfused cell number: 66.25 × 10). Two patients did not start lymphodepletion. Nine patients received at least 1 dose of interleukin 2 (median number: 10; range, 1-10), seven started nivolumab (median number: 5; range, 2-23). All patients had hematologic adverse events (AEs). Most common non-hematologic AEs were fever and cytokine release syndrome. No nivolumab-associated AEs of ≥ grade 2 occurred. The objective response rate to TIL-ACT was 22% (2/9, 2 partial remission).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: TIL-ACT with nivolumab is feasible and safe. Larger trials are needed to further determine the efficacy of this combination.\n",
